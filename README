A simulation of an ocean containing sharks and fish.  
The ocean is rectangular, but the edges are connected
together in a topological donut or torus.  
The ocean is divided into square cells, which are indexed as follows
(for a 4x3 ocean):

                         ------> x

                     |   -----------------------------
                     |   | 0, 0 | 1, 0 | 2, 0 | 3, 0 |
                   y |   -----------------------------
                     |   | 0, 1 | 1, 1 | 2, 1 | 3, 1 |
                     v   -----------------------------
                         | 0, 2 | 1, 2 | 2, 2 | 3, 2 |
                         -----------------------------

There are two kinds of entities in this ocean:  sharks and fish.  The sharks
and fish breed, eat, and die in the ocean.  Each cell of the grid can be
occupied by a single shark or fish, or it can be empty.


The contents of any particular cell at the end of a timestep depend only on the
contents of that cell and its eight neighbors at the beginning of the timestep.


1) If a cell contains a shark, and any of its neighbors is a fish, then the
shark eats during the timestep, and it remains in the cell at the end of the
timestep with its hunger completely gone.  

2) If a cell contains a shark, and none of its neighbors is a fish, it gets
hungrier during the timestep.  If this timestep is the (starveTime + 1)th
consecutive timestep the shark has gone through without eating, then the shark
dies (disappears).  Otherwise, it remains in the cell.  

3) If a cell contains a fish, and all of its neighbors are either empty or are
other fish, then the fish stays where it is.

4) If a cell contains a fish, and one of its neighbors is a shark, then the
fish is eaten by a shark, and therefore disappears.

5) If a cell contains a fish, and two or more of its neighbors are sharks, then
a new shark is born in that cell.  Sharks are well-fed at birth; _after_ they
are born, they can survive an additional starveTime timesteps without eating.

6) If a cell is empty, and fewer than two of its neighbors are fish, then the
cell remains empty.

7) If a cell is empty, at least two of its neighbors are fish, and at most one
of its neighbors is a shark, then a new fish is born in that cell.

8) If a cell is empty, at least two of its neighbors are fish, and at least two
of its neighbors are sharks, then a new shark is born in that cell.  


In the animation produced by Simulation, sharks are red squares and fish are
green squares.  In the animation produced by SimText, sharks are 'S' characters
and fish are '~' characters.
